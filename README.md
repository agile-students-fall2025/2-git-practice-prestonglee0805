## Opinion  

What I find most interesting about this article is how it reframes the role of senior developers in an AI-driven world. Instead of being purely creators, they’ve become curators who are reviewing, correcting, and steering AI outputs. At first this sounds like extra overhead, almost like babysitting. But the reality is that this oversight role reflects a deeper truth about software engineering: the hardest part isn’t writing code, it’s ensuring that the code is correct, maintainable, and aligned with long-term goals.  

I like that the article doesn’t just celebrate the speed gains of vibe coding but also acknowledges the hidden costs and responsibilities it creates. To me, this shift highlights how important human judgment and craftsmanship still are, even when AI tools become more powerful.  


## Comment — Cyryl

I agree with your point that senior developers are moving from pure builders to careful editors of AI work. The article shows that this can still be a win when we shape the workflow. Let the agent handle scaffolding and boilerplate, while humans own architecture, data models, security, and the final review.
